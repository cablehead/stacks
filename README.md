Stacks is a clipboard manager.

## About

With so many great clipboard managers already available, why create another one?

I think of my clipboard as "picking things up" to move them around or redirect
them. In this sense, your system's clipboard acts as a strong proxy for your
["locus of attention"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/humane-interface-the/0201379376/0201379376_ch02lev1sec3.html)
when you're using a computer.

A clipboard manager, then, is a tool to capture and work with your "locus of
attention." It ambiently captures your current tasks and work _context_.

Stacks is an experimental tool for tracking and manipulating your current
context using pipes and filters. But that‚Äôs a lot to explain, so I usually just
describe it as a clipboard manager.

A humble clipboard manager [aspiring](https://x.com/cablelounger/status/1854955656526127398) to elevate the depth of our conversations‚Äî
no less.

## UX disclaimer

A quick note on the user experience (UX): it‚Äôs fair to say it‚Äôs still a bit
rough around the edges. If Stacks reaches a UX level similar to (neo)vim, I'd
consider that a success. It‚Äôs pretty spartan and utilitarian, so being
comfortable with the command line, or feeling adventurous, definitely helps.

Stacks is my personal
["tool for thought"](https://maggieappleton.com/tools-for-thought) that I use as
my daily driver. Eventually, I‚Äôd like Stacks to reach the polish of tools like
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), but for now, the focus is on its experimental
nature and the underlying
[event-sourcing store](https://github.com/cablehead/xs).

## Give it a try!

If you're into experimental tools and are okay with a minimalist,
utilitarian design, give Stacks a try-- I'd love to hear your thoughts!
