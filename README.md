## Todo

### Next release

- Test against a clean empty state
- Overhaul storage

### Next release

- Focus clips which are generated by Stacks

- Add ability to create a Note

- Potentially rename Clipboard to.. /?

### And then

- Clicking trigger in the Actions Modal doesn't trigger the action

- Copying an item should put it at the top of stacks

- Going to want multi-select to add

- shift-enter to copy but keep stacks open: maybe
- or shift-enter: replace

- Editor
    - access clips while editor is open

- Preference panel

- Editor capture should create an xs.add row: with parent set to the id the
  editor was triggered on: this should be merged version that's put on the
  clipboard

- better cursor handling
    - dedicated focus handling when the filter changes
    - unless the item being added is the item focused, in which case, jump to
      the first?? - maybe
    - reset to start state of 1 minute

- mark a source as don't track (for password managers, etc).

- meta panel. add: image info

- handle clipboard images
    - when the user hits enter

- customize key press
- meta-n opens choice: note / command
- add filter: number of times copied

- Actions menu: Add icons to options
