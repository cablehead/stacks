## Storage

content.add: id, hash  # need to be able give a type

content_type is:

- Text
- Link
- Stack
- Image

mime_type is:

- text/plain
- image/png

Potentially source

stack.add: id, id
stack.del: id, id
edit.add: id, id

xs_lib::store_put(&env, Some("clipboard".into()), None, line.clone())
xs_lib::store_put(&env, Some("stack".into()), None, data).unwrap();
xs_lib::store_put(&env, Some("stack".into()), Some("delete".into()), data).unwrap();
xs_lib::store_put(&env, Some("item".into()), None, item).unwrap();
xs_lib::store_put(&env, Some("link".into()), None, data).unwrap();


## Release

## Todo

### To release

id source_id parent_id

- add to stack
    - it feels weird the new item in the stack has no touches
    - they're tied together: able to tell what context something is from when
      rendering in a another given content
    - so maybe, the item is touched: but the parent version ignores that, in
      terms of sorting by most recently touched.
    - or:
    - this should fork the item by default
    - the added item shouldn't be marked as touched: result of being forked

- delete

- delete from stack
    - and because its fork by default: that just means from the stack, not the
      outer item

- while in stack, new items go to that stack

- Copy entire stack puts the entire stack on the clipboard, but doesn't save it
  to the store


### Next release

- truncate long urls
- limit height for status pane

- Focus clips which are generated by Stacks
- Reset to the first item after some period of inactivity (30 secs?)

- Add ability to create a Note

- Potentially rename Clipboard to.. /?

### And then

- Clicking trigger in the Actions Modal doesn't trigger the action

- Copying an item should put it at the top of stacks

- Going to want multi-select to add

- shift-enter to copy but keep stacks open: maybe
- or shift-enter: replace

- Editor
    - access clips while editor is open

- Preference panel

- Editor capture should create an xs.add row: with parent set to the id the
  editor was triggered on: this should be merged version that's put on the
  clipboard

- better cursor handling
    - dedicated focus handling when the filter changes
    - unless the item being added is the item focused, in which case, jump to
      the first?? - maybe
    - reset to start state of 1 minute

- mark a source as don't track (for password managers, etc).

- meta panel. add: image info

- handle clipboard images
    - when the user hits enter

- customize key press
- meta-n opens choice: note / command
- add filter: number of times copied

- Actions menu: Add icons to options
