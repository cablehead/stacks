## Todo

- better cursor handling
    - dedicated focus handling when the filter changes
    - if the first item isn't selected and an item is added, move the cursor
      down one to keep focus steady
    - unless the item being added is the item focused, in which case, jump to
      the first?? - maybe
    - reset to start state of 1 minute

- mark a source as don't track (for password managers, etc).

- clean up meta panel. add:
    - image info

- handle clipboard images
    - in preview: improve transparency
    - when the user hits enter

- new clipboard items can stop updating

- customize key press
- meta-n opens choice: note / command
- add filter: content type
- add filter: number of times copied
