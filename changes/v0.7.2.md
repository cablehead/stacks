This releases begins to improve basic UX around Stacks

Features:

- A new action has been added for Stack: command-Enter, which copies all content in the stack, separated by new lines
- When editing an item within a Stack, the new version replaces the old version. The old version is still preserved in global stack. A link is now create between the new and old items: this link isn't visible yet though
- The light / dark theme now defaults to the user's system's preference
- We're now generating builds for Intel Macs! (for Toby).

Bug fixes:

- Improved navigation: keep focus on the currently selected item, when items are added
- The parent Stack now sees new items in real time
- When adding to a Stack, clicking on a target Stack name now works
